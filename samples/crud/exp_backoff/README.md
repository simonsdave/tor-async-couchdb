#Exponential Backoff Strategy Sample
This service implements a simple RESTful service that
builds on the [retry sample](../retry).
Specifically, this sample illustrates how
to realize an exponential backoff strategy during on-write retry.
If you compare the [retry sample's async actions logic](../retry/async_actions.py)
with [this sample's async action logic](async_actions.py) you'll
see the introduction of the exponential backoff strategy when conflicts are detected.

Everything ITO creating the CouchDB database, running the service, etc
is the same as for [retry sample](../retry). The only outward difference
you should be able to detect between this sample and the [retry sample](../retry)
can be found in the service's logs after running a stress test.
More specifically, try grepping the service's logs per the example
below. Contention levels created by the [load generator](../loadgen) 
will determine how many retries are attempted.

```bash
(env)>grep "Conflict detected updating fruit" service.log
